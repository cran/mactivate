Description: Provides methods and classes for adding m-activation ("multiplicative activation") layers to MLR or multivariate logistic regression models.  M-activation layers created in this library detect and add input interaction (polynomial) effects into a predictive model.  M-activation can detect high-order interactions -- a traditionally non-trivial challenge.  Details concerning application, methodology, and relevant survey literature can be found in this library's vignette, "About."
